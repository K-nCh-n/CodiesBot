# CodiesBot
A Discord Bot to play Codies

This is a bot I made while learning how to use the Java Discord API. Probably has a lot of room for optimisation and improvement so feel free to suggest some!

The bot should let users play a game of codenames, using the relatively new Discord Buttons as tiles. The goal is to try and guess as many tiles that match your colour with clues from a spymaster, who knows what are the actual colours of the tiles. The game ends when one team colour has no more tiles of their colour left on the grid.
